This is a Notepad app created with a decoupled architecture, featuring a Django backend and a React.js frontend. The backend, built using Django REST Framework (DRF), handles the server-side logic, including user authentication and CRUD operations for notes. Data is stored in a database defined by Django models, while APIs expose endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes. The backend ensures secure and efficient management of data, enabling seamless interaction between the client and server.

The frontend, developed with React.js, provides an interactive and responsive user interface. Axios is used to facilitate communication with the backend by making HTTP requests to the API endpoints. For instance, users can create a new note, which sends a POST request, or fetch all notes with a GET request. The application dynamically updates the UI based on user actions, delivering a smooth user experience. This architecture separates concerns, making the app scalable, maintainable, and adaptable to future enhancements.
